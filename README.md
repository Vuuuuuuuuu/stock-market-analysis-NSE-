# 📈 Stock Market Prediction Dashboard

An end-to-end **AI-powered stock prediction system** built with **Flask (Python backend)** and a **modern Tailwind/Chart.js frontend**.  
The system uses **machine learning models (XGBoost)** trained on historical NSE data to forecast stock prices, visualize actual vs predicted trends, and provide model performance metrics.
